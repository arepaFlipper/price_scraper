In this project I learned:
- What web scraping really is.
- Build a tool to leverage it.
- Handling `CAPTCHA`s.
- Anti-scraping measures.
- IP rotation.

### Crawlers vs Scrappers
| Aspect  | Web Crawlers   | Web Scraper   |
|-------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Main function    | Navigates the web, indexes content     | Extracts specific data from web pages |
| Navigation | Follows links to discover new pages| Targets individual pages for data extraction.|
| Usage | SEO analysis | - Any piece of data <br> - Dataset generation for ML training |

#### Web crawlers
Is what Google Chrome or other browsers use to index websites, they
too navigate through out whole website first find links and rank them
accordingly.

#### Web scraping
It targets specific types of websites on their page, it's more about 
focusing on what truly matters.

##### How do web scrapers truly work?
1. Send HTTP request (automatic).
2. Server Replies to our scrapers request with the website content (HTML, JavaScript, CSS).
3. Parse the Response.
4. Filter the desired data.
5. Store the extracted data in a database.
6. Use it for training ML models or building new apps.

## Features

## (1:09:32) BrightData proxy configuration


## (1:11:10) Environment Variables

## (1:14:10) Install axios
Axios is a library for making HTTP requests in Node.js and React.
```bash
‚ùØ npm install axios
```
## (1:14:44) Install cheerio
Cheerio is a library for parsing HTML and extracting data from it.
```bash
‚ùØ npm install cheerio



```
The following is an example of how cheerio is used to scrape the amazon product page:
```html
 <h1 id="title" class="a-size-large a-spacing-none"> 
   <span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">YMDK 120 Keys ABS ANSI ISO 1.5mm Blank Milk Fog OEM Profile Shine Through Keycap for MX Mechanical Keyboard RGB GK61 96 84 68 108 87</span>     
 </h1> 
```

To extract the text content of the element, we can use the following code:
```js
    const $ = cheerio.load(response.data);
    const title = $("#productTitle").text().trim();
```

It search for the element with the id of "productTitle" in the HTML document and returns the text content of that element.

Be aware that sometimes Amazon prompts the previous prices to show the discounted price, this could confuse the data extraction.
