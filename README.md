# e-Commerce Price scrapper
## Overview

Welcome to the e-Commerce Price Tracker repository! This project monitors the actions of platforms such as Amazon and provides you with the latest price of the products you are looking for.
And it gives users precisely when it's the optimal moment to make a purchase.

In this project I learned:
- What web scraping really is.
- Build a tool to leverage it.
- Handling `CAPTCHA`s.
- Anti-scraping measures.
- IP rotation.

### Crawlers vs Scrappers
| Aspect  | Web Crawlers   | Web Scraper   |
|-------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Main function    | Navigates the web, indexes content     | Extracts specific data from web pages |
| Navigation | Follows links to discover new pages| Targets individual pages for data extraction.|
| Usage | SEO analysis | - Any piece of data <br> - Dataset generation for ML training |

#### Web crawlers
Is what Google Chrome or other browsers use to index websites, they
too navigate through out whole website first find links and rank them
accordingly.

#### Web scraping
It targets specific types of websites on their page, it's more about 
focusing on what truly matters.

##### How do web scrapers truly work?
1. Send HTTP request (automatic).
2. Server Replies to our scrapers request with the website content (HTML, JavaScript, CSS).
3. Parse the Response.
4. Filter the desired data.
5. Store the extracted data in a database.
6. Use it for training ML models or building new apps.
